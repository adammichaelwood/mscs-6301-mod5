## Getting Started

A Java program that reads a list of Integer numbers from the scanned input 
and saves them into a stack sorted from the smallest to the largest. 
The program asks for integers one at a time from the console and
stops when the user presses enter without typing a number.
Each number is saved into the stack when it is received. 
If the user types something other than an integer, 
a short error/correction message is displayed.
When the user is done, the stack is printed to the console.
